Mesh-Fracturing
The following is a basic mesh fracturing application built in openGL. The program leverages the use of a geometry shader in order to create individual fragments of an object. The geometry shader calculates the normals of each individual fragment and translates the fragment in the direction of its normal.

Technologies Used
    Texture Mapping
    Pitch & Yaw
